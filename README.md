# TextSentimentAnalysis
Utilized NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) to perform text processing and cleaning. The Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm has been chosen to train on the dataset for text sentiment analysis. The model will classify the sentence into three sentiment categories, positive, neutral, and negative. This repo serves as a demonstration for text sentiment analysis hence it did not include large dataset complex model training.

# Notes
The final model will be deployed as discord bot using Amazon Web Service (AWS) and discord bot APIs.
## Requirements
1. Please do create your own discord bot token and put in args while running the script ```deployment_discordbot.py```.
2. In this repo, AWS EC2 instance is chosen for the deployment. *You may use any other cloud service for deployment. 

# Sample Result
